<h1>Conduct a Security Audit</h1>
In this activity, we will conduct a internal cybersecurity audit based on a fictional company. Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location. However, its online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. Their infomation technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide.  
<br /> <br/>
The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. He expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. He believes an internal audit can help better secure the company's infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).
 <br /> <br/>
 The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture. The IT manager wants to use the audit findings as evidence to obtain approval to expand his department. 


<h2>Summary</h2>

The Audit needs to align current business practices with industry standards and best practices. The audit is meant to provide mitigation recommendations for vulnerabilities found that are classified as "high risk", and present an overall strategy for improving the security posture of the organization. The audit team needs to document their findings, provide remediation plans and efforts, and communicate with stakeholders.

<h2>Botium Toys: Risk Assessment</h2>
<h3>Current assets</h3>
<h4>Assets managed by the IT Department include: </h4>

- On-premises equipment for in-office business needs
- Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones),
remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations,
surveillance cameras, etc.
- Management of systems, software, and services: accounting,
telecommunication, database, security, ecommerce, and inventory
management
- Internet access
- Internal network
- Vendor access management
- Data center hosting services
- Data retention and storage
- Badge readers
- Legacy system maintenance: end-of-life systems that require human
monitoring

<h3>Risk description</h3>

Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does
not have the proper controls in place and may not be compliant with U.S. and
international regulations and standards.

<h3>Control best practices</h3>

The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is Identify. Botium Toys will need to
dedicate resources to managing assets. Additionally, they will need to determine the
impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.

<h3>Risk score</h3>

On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is 8, which is fairly high. This is due to a lack of
controls and adherence to necessary compliance regulations and standards.

<h3>Additional comments</h3>

The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as medium, because the IT
department does not know which assets would be lost. The likelihood of a lost asset or
fines from governing bodies is high because Botium Toys does not have all of the
necessary controls in place and is not adhering to required regulations and standards
related to keeping customer data private.
